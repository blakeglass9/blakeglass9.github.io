Learning Python has significantly expanded my technical skill set and deepened my understanding of programming principles. One of the most notable skills I’ve gained is the ability to write clean, 
efficient code that is both scalable and maintainable. Python’s simple syntax has enabled me to focus on logic and structure, improving my problem-solving abilities and enhancing my analytical thinking.
Through working on various projects such as creating phonebooks or transferring files between directories, I’ve gained experience with essential Python libraries like tkinter for building user interfaces and sqlite3
for managing databases. This exposure to real-world applications has taught me how to design systems that can store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently, giving me a firm grasp of database management and 
GUI development.
