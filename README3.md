I have recently gained comprehensive experience in developing applications using C# and ASP.NET Core, focusing on both front-end and back-end development. Through this course, I built multiple projects to showcase my technical skills. For instance, I created an ASP.NET MVC web application for calculating car insurance quotes based on various business rules, integrating Entity Framework Code-First to manage data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I developed an NFL Stats application designed to store and display records for NFL teams, leveraging data visualization techniques and demonstrating my ability to work with structured data.
